## What's this?

Bearded.Utilities is a C# library full of useful utilities for games and other applications.

Most of it is extracted from or written explicitly for the projects of [Paul Scharf](http://github.com/amulware) and [Tom Rijnbeek](http://github.com/tomrijnbeek), including [Roche Fusion](http://rochefusion.com) and [TD](https://github.com/beardgame/td).

We believe in reusing useful and generic code to accelerate development. With this project, we want to compile and share code that we find useful and reusable.
